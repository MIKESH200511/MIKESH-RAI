    <h5> About us </h5>
    <h1>Welcome to Study Hub</h1>
    <p>The Study Hub offers students diverse learning experiences in and outside the classroom. Learning about Finnish culture and language on campus is important to fit in, but the things you do outside of class will help you understand Finland even more.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>This spring, we learned about Finnish traditions, culture, and food while exploring Helsinki and the surrounding areas. Is there a better way to appreciate a different culture than to have fun while trying new things? The Study Hub is located in Helsinki, the capital of Finland. The city offers a wide range of things to do and places to see in all four seasons. Let's talk more about what we did with the Study Hub students this spring!</p>
